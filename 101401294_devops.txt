COMP 3104 - DevOps Course

DevOps is a transformative approach in the software development industry that emphasizes collaboration between 
development and operations teams. By fostering a culture of shared responsibility, DevOps aims to shorten the 
development lifecycle, increase deployment frequency, and improve the quality of software products. This methodology 
is essential in todayâ€™s fast-paced tech landscape, where organizations must rapidly adapt to changing market demands 
and customer expectations.
Topics:
- Continuous Integration (CI): Automating the process of merging code changes and running tests to ensure compatibility.
- Continuous Delivery (CD): Automating the delivery of code changes to production environments.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through code, rather than manual processes.
- Containerization: Using Docker and Kubernetes to create lightweight, portable software environments.

Therefore, by the end of the course, students are expected to have a strong understanding of how to implement these practices 
using popular DevOps tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes.
