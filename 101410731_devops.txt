What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the development lifecycle and ensure high software quality by fostering collaboration between teams, automation, and continuous delivery.
Why is DevOps Important?

    Faster Delivery: By automating processes like testing, integration, and deployment, DevOps reduces time-to-market.
    Higher Quality: Continuous testing ensures that bugs are detected early in the development process.
    Improved Collaboration: Developers and operations teams work together throughout the software lifecycle.
    Better Customer Experience: Faster releases mean quicker delivery of new features and improvements to users.
    Reduced Downtime: Automated monitoring and quick rollbacks minimize disruptions during deployment.

Key DevOps Practices

    Continuous Integration (CI):
    Developers frequently integrate their code changes into the main branch, and each integration is verified through automated testing.

    Continuous Delivery (CD):
    Software updates are automatically prepared for release, enabling fast and reliable deployment to production environments.

    Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
    Infrastructure (like servers and networks) is managed through code, making it easy to replicate, scale, and automate.

    Monitoring and Logging:
    Continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure ensures issues are detected before they affect users.

    Version Control:
    Tools like Git allow for tracking code changes and collaborating efficiently.
