Key Learning Outcomes:

    Understanding DevOps Principles:
        Bridging the gap between development and operations teams.
        Promoting collaboration across all stages of software development.

    Automation and CI/CD Pipelines:
        Automating build, test, and deployment processes.
        Setting up CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Azure DevOps.

    Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
        Using tools like Docker and Kubernetes to manage infrastructure.
        Automating infrastructure deployment with Terraform and cloud platforms.

    Monitoring and Logging:
        Using monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to ensure system health.
        Collecting logs and metrics for proactive issue resolution.

    Version Control and Collaboration:
        Mastering Git for version control and managing branches effectively.
        Collaborating on code using platforms like GitHub and Bitbucket.

Importance of DevOps in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):

    Continuous Feedback Loop: DevOps enables continuous feedback from both development and operations teams, improving software quality.
    Faster Time to Market: Automating tasks reduces delays, allowing for faster delivery of new features and updates.
    Reduced Downtime and Better Scalability: Continuous monitoring and automation minimize downtime and make systems more scalable.
